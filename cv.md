## About myself:  
I graduated from medical iniversity in 2020 and used to work as a pharmasist, but than realised that it is not what I want to do for living. I started learning html, css and javascript and this topic aroused my interest. I believe I can do my best as a front-end developer.  
## Skills and Proficiency:  
+ HTML5, CSS3  
+ JavaScript Basics  
+ Git, GitHub  
+  VS Code  
+  Adobe Photoshop  
**Work experience:**  defended [graduation project](http://fe.it-academy.by/Sites/0043256/index.html) after finishing course from IT Academy 
## Code example:  
**Quadrants KATA from CODEWARS:** Given a point in a Euclidean plane (x and y), return the quadrant the point exists in: 1, 2, 3 or 4 (integer). x and y are non-zero integers, therefore the given point never lies on the axes.  
**Solution:**
```
function quadrant(x, y) {
  if (x > 0 && y > 0) return 1;
  else if (x < 0 && y > 0) return 2;
  else if (x < 0 && y < 0) return 3;
  else if (x > 0 && y < 0) return 4;
    }
```
